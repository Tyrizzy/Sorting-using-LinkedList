# Sorting-using-LinkedList

I created this sorting program for a final at my undergrad. I was given 2 weeks to complete it. I used LinkedList funtions that I made (with help from the internet) and File I/O to bring this project to life.

Application: LinkedList

How to run: Download the code as a zip file. Once downloaded, unzip the folder. Once uzipped, open the folder and run the application file.

*Note: When tyring to run the application windows may mark it as unrecongnized. If so just click more info and run anyway.The file is totally safe to run because it says the same thing to me even when I download it.
